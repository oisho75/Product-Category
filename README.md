# Product-Category
Product/Category relationship 
For Controller. I have alot of extra files in this directory that dont directly
work with the project but they helped me to learn Symfony/PHP. The main Controller 
files that are useful are the ones with aqua in the name. aquaP, aquaPD, and aquaPU are to create
a product, delete a product, and update a product. aquaC, aquaCD, and aqua CU do the
same for categories. aquaDisplay displays all the products, categories, and buttons.
